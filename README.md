Ace (Abstract Computers Emulator) 
================================== 

Ace is an abstracts computers emulator and at its first moment aimed to emulate Turing Machines, 
Multi-Tape Turing Machines, Push-Down Automata and Finite Automaton, where all these ones are 
Deterministic and Non-Deterministic ones. 

This project is being build using TDD process (Test Driven Development) and another software 
engineering techniques, e.g., high cohesion, low coupling, software versioning system and flow 
techniques, GUI, application, database layers, etc. In addition, lately, using an open source 
[license](LICENSE) GNU GLP version 3 or any later version. 

## Current State at 16/11/2015 

It's current state is very initial and there is not any ready emulation. Nowadays it is being focus 
to develop by a top-down construction method starting at its Graphical Interface layer, then 
follow up some basic prototypes and go down to the System Logic and Data Store layer using the 
same strategy as before. But taking priority to high potencial risks like Non-Deterministic Turing 
Machines.
